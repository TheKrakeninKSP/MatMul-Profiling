# Compiler Optimization Techniques for Reducing Cache Misses in Matrix Multiplication

## Introduction  
This project analyzes various **matrix multiplication (512 Ã— 512) optimization techniques** to improve cache utilization and execution speed. The optimizations include:  
- **Loop Interchange**  
- **Loop Blocking**  
- **Loop Unrolling**  
- **Loop Fusion**  

Performance metrics such as **execution time, cache misses, and CPU cycles** were evaluated using Perf.

## Optimization Techniques  

### Loop Interchange  
ðŸ”¹ Changes the order of loop nesting to improve memory access patterns.  
**Results:** Negligible improvement, sometimes worsening performance.  

### Loop Blocking  
ðŸ”¹ Divides the matrix into smaller blocks to improve cache reuse.  
**Results:** Achieved a **3.7% improvement** in execution time.  

### Loop Unrolling  
ðŸ”¹ Expands loop iterations to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.  
**Results:** Improved execution time by **28.1%** but increased L1 cache pressure.  

### Loop Fusion  
ðŸ”¹ Merges multiple loops to reduce loop overhead and enhance cache efficiency.  
**Results:** Best performance boost with a **40.4% reduction** in execution time.

## Performance Metrics (Before vs After Optimization)  

| Optimization  | Execution Time â†“ | L1 D-Cache Load Misses â†“ | LLC Load Misses â†“ |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Loop Interchange** | -1.2% (Worse) | ðŸ”º Increased | ðŸ”º Increased |
| **Loop Blocking** | âœ… +3.7% | âœ… -80% | âœ… -98% |
| **Loop Unrolling** | âœ… +28.1% | ðŸ”º Increased | ðŸ”º Increased |
| **Loop Fusion** | ðŸš€ +40.4% | âœ… Reduced | âœ… Drastically Reduced |

Loop Fusion proved to be the **most effective optimization**, reducing both execution time and cache misses.
